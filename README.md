# What is DOE2py?
It is a set of Python scripts to faciliate the process of running building energy simulations using DOE-2. **This project is a work in progress.**

# Useful scripts:
### RunDOE2 (Works)
Synthax:
`DOE2py.py RunDOE2 path_inp_file path_weather_file DOE2version`

* `path_inp_file`: complete path to the DOE-2 input file, do not include the extension.
* `path_weather_file`: complete path to the DOE-2 input file, include the extension.
* `DOE2version`: name of the version of DOE-2 used for the simulation

# Future updates:
* Small GUI using PyForms
* Select user defined library library
* Create 'nice' output form, html?, json?, sqlite? markdown?
